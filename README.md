This is my prototype project 
I am building a small dashboard to manage properties, tenants, and rent payments.

Day 1
  - Created basic Spring Boot setup  
  - Added starter Application class  
  - Made placeholder JSP pages (dashboard, properties, rent form, payment list)  
  - Wrote SQL file with just database creation  

 Day 2
  - Added first entity class (`Property.java`)  
  - Created `properties` table in SQL  
  - Updated properties.jsp (added note that DB integration will come later)  
  - Hibernate/DB connection is not working yet  

 Tech Stack
- Java (Spring Boot)  
- JSP, HTML, CSS  
- MySQL (only basic table right now)  
- Maven  

How to run (right now)
1. Open in IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse)  
2. Run `Application.java`  
3. Go to: [http://localhost:8080/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dashboard)  

At this stage it only shows placeholder pages with “work in progress” notes.  
Today I learned how to create an entity class and a simple SQL table.  
I still need to figure out Hibernate and how to display DB data on JSP.  
That’s the next step I want to try.
