 Property Dashboard Prototype

This is my prototype project. 
Right now I have only set up the basic structure. More work will be added in the next few days.  

 Current Progress (Day 1)
- Spring Boot project is created  
- Added starter Application class  
- Added some JSP pages (Dashboard, Properties, Rent Form, Payment List) 
- Created one SQL file for database (just made database, tables will come later)  

 Tech Stack
- Java (Spring Boot)
- JSP, HTML, CSS
- MySQL (not fully connected yet)

 How to run (for now)
1. Open the project in IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse)  
2. Run `Application.java`  
3. Visit [http://localhost:8080/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dashboard)  
  Right now it only displays a simple "Work in Progress" message because I have not connected the database or logic yet. I will add features in the next few days.
  This is only the starting point. I will be adding database entities, controllers, and real features step by step in the next commits.
