Property Dashboard Prototype

This is my prototype project  
I am building a small dashboard to manage properties, tenants, and rent payments.

Progress so far
Day 1  
  - Basic Spring Boot setup done  
  - Added starter Application class  
  - Created placeholder JSP pages (dashboard, properties, rent form, payment list)  
  - Wrote SQL file with only DB creation  

  Day 2
  - Added Property entity class  
  - Created properties table in SQL  
  - Updated properties.jsp with “work in progress” note  
  - Hibernate connection still not done  

  Day 3
  - Added Tenant entity class  
  - Created tenants table in SQL  
  - Added a new JSP page for tenants (currently placeholder)  
  - Updated dashboard page to mention Property and Tenant  
    
 Tech Stack
- Java (Spring Boot)  
- JSP, HTML, CSS  
- MySQL (basic tables only right now)  
- Maven  

How to run (current stage)
1. Open in IDE (I’m using IntelliJ).  
2. Run Application.java.  
3. Go to browser: [http://localhost:8080/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dashboard).  

At my side it only shows placeholder JSPs with “work in progress” messages.  
Database integration not working yet.
